# ðŸš€ My Awesome Secure CI/CD Pipeline on AWS!

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my little corner of the internet where I've put together a really cool project: a fully automated and super secure CI/CD pipeline on AWS. This isn't just about deploying code; it's about doing it securely, right from the start!

I've used a bunch of awesome tools like Terraform to set up all the AWS magic (even deploying to EC2!) and then hooked it up with GitHub Actions to build, scan, test, and get my containerized apps running on Kubernetes. Oh, and managing those pesky secrets? I've got that covered with Kubernetes Sealed Secrets, so everything stays super safe.

Think of this as your go-to guide if you're into Infrastructure as Code (IaC), making sure your code is safe, and automating all the deployment fun.
